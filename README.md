# breakout
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/stickyPiston/breakout.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/stickyPiston/breakout)

The retro [breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) game built using asdf-games and electron.

### 🕹️ Play it yourself!

#### Easy mode
Grab an executable from the "releases" tab for your operating system and architecture. Once it's downloaded, run it and be mindblown.

#### Hacker mode
Build breakout yourself. Type into your terminal the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stickyPiston/breakout.git
cd breakout && npm i
```
If you don't get any errors, you should be able to play the game! Yay! To play the game, run `npm start`.

### 🐛 Are you a bug exterminator?
Feel free to create an issue, or even better, a pull request.

### 😴 Getting bored playing breakout?
If you come up with new features, I will (try to) integrate them into the game. All you have to do is to create an issue in the "issues" tab and describe your addition to breakout.
